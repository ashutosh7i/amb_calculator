## What is Average Monthly Balance (AMB)?

Average Monthly Balance (AMB) is a financial metric used by banks to calculate the average amount of money maintained in a bank account over a month. It is an essential criterion for various types of bank accounts, especially savings accounts. AMB is calculated by adding the closing balance of an account for each day of a month and then dividing it by the number of days in that month.

## How AMB is Calculated

1. **Collect Daily Closing Balances**: For each day of the month, collect the closing balance of the bank account.

2. **Sum the Closing Balances**: Add up all the daily closing balances for the month.

3. **Calculate Average**: Divide the sum of closing balances by the number of days in the month.

   **AMB = (Sum of Daily Closing Balances) / (Number of Days in the Month)**
